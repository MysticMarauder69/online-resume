      I'm currently an Executive Services Manager at Wiggin looking to branch
      out into coding and find a new career path. I built my first PC when I was
      10 years old & continue to be an avid learner in relation to IT
      infrastructures/software development.

      I have a passion for Gaming & have been since I was 6 years old. I play an
      array of games (RPG, Open World, Adventure), currently Infinity Nikki is
      my favourite.
