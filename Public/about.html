<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Dani. I've been in my current role for 17 years now, I've worked
  here since I was 16 - you do the maths. I decided to branch out into coding
  because it's an area I've always been good at and the future is Technology.
</p>

<p>
  I love gaming - I stream my content on Twitch with Baldurs Gate 3, Elden Ring,
  Disney Dreamlight Valley, Dragon Age Veilguard & more recently, Infinity Nikki
  which I am obsessed with at the moment. I really love talking to people and
  building a community, that's my main reason for streaming (and because I'm a
  talky gamer)
